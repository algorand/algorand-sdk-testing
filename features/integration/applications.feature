Feature: Applications
   Background:
      Given an algod client
      And a kmd client
      And wallet information
      And an algod v2 client connected to "localhost" port 60000 with token "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa"

   Scenario: Use every applications feature in one scenario, do it!
      # Make these tests 'standalone'.
      # This should create a new, random account and save the public/private key for future steps to use.
      Given I create a new transient account and fund it with 100000000 microalgos.
      # Create application
      # depends on the transient account, and also the application id.
      # Use suggested params
      And I build an application transaction with the transient account, the current application, suggested params, operation "create", approval-program "programs/one.teal.tok", clear-program "programs/one.teal.tok", global-bytes 0, global-ints 0, local-bytes 1, local-ints 0, app-args "", foreign-apps "", app-accounts ""
      # If error is an empty string, there should be no error.
      And I sign and submit the transaction. If there is an error it is "".
      And I wait for the transaction to be confirmed.
      And I remember the new application ID.
      # Update approval program to 'loccheck'
      And I build an application transaction with the transient account, the current application, suggested params, operation "update", approval-program "programs/loccheck.teal.tok", clear-program "programs/one.teal.tok", global-bytes 0, global-ints 0, local-bytes 0, local-ints 0, app-args "", foreign-apps "", app-accounts ""

      And I wait for the transaction to be confirmed.
      # OptIn - with error (missing argument)
