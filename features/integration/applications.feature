Feature: Applications
   Background:
      Given an algod client
      And a kmd client
      And wallet information
      And an algod v2 client connected to "localhost" port 60000 with token "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa"

   Scenario Outline: <state-location> test - Use every applications feature!
      # Make these tests 'standalone'.
      # This should create a new, random account and save the public/private key for future steps to use.
      Given I create a new transient account and fund it with 100000000 microalgos.
      # Application create with extra pages should succeed with expected message.
      And I build an application transaction with the transient account, the current application, suggested params, operation "create", approval-program "programs/big_app_program.teal.tok", clear-program "programs/big_app_program.teal.tok", global-bytes <global-bytes>, global-ints 0, local-bytes <local-bytes>, local-ints 0, app-args "", foreign-apps "", foreign-assets "", app-accounts "", extra-pages 3
      And I sign and submit the transaction, saving the txid. If there is an error it is "logic eval error: pc=704 dynamic cost budget exceeded, executing intc_1: local program cost was 700. Details: pc=704, opcodes=intc_1 // 1".

      # Create application
      # depends on the transient account, and also the application id.
      # Use suggested params
      And I build an application transaction with the transient account, the current application, suggested params, operation "create", approval-program "programs/one.teal.tok", clear-program "programs/one.teal.tok", global-bytes <global-bytes>, global-ints 0, local-bytes <local-bytes>, local-ints 0, app-args "", foreign-apps "", foreign-assets "", app-accounts "", extra-pages 0
      # If error is an empty string, there should be no error.
      And I sign and submit the transaction, saving the txid. If there is an error it is "".
      And I wait for the transaction to be confirmed.
      And I remember the new application ID.
      Then I get the account address for the current application and see that it matches the app id's hash
      # Update approval program to 'loccheck'
