  Scenario:
    * an algod v2 client
    * a kmd client
    * wallet information
    * suggested transaction parameters from the algod v2 client
    * I create a new transient account and fund it with 100000000 microalgos.
    * I make a transaction signer for the transient account.
    * I reset the array of application IDs to remember.

    ###### ------ app at context index 0: FakeRandom ------ ######
    When I build an application transaction with the transient account, the current application, suggested params, operation "create", approval-program "programs/fake_random.teal", clear-program "programs/six.teal", global-bytes 0, global-ints 1, local-bytes 0, local-ints 0, app-args "", foreign-apps "", foreign-assets "", app-accounts "", extra-pages 0
    And I sign and submit the transaction, saving the txid. If there is an error it is "".
    And I wait for the transaction to be confirmed.
    Given I remember the new application ID.

    Given a new AtomicTransactionComposer

    # randInt(42) -> (r, witnessString)
    Given I add the nonce "Thing One"
    When I create the Method object from method signature "randInt(uint64)(uint64,byte[17])"
    * I create a new method arguments array.
    * I append the encoded arguments "AAAAAAAAACo=" to the method arguments array.
    * I add a nonced method call with the transient account, the current application, suggested params, on complete "noop", current transaction signer, current method arguments.

    # randInt(1337) -> (r, witnessString)
    Given I add the nonce "Thing Two"
    When I create the Method object from method signature "randInt(uint64)(uint64,byte[17])"
    * I create a new method arguments array.
    * I append the encoded arguments "AAAAAAAABTk=" to the method arguments array.
    * I add a nonced method call with the transient account, the current application, suggested params, on complete "noop", current transaction signer, current method arguments.

    Then I build the transaction group with the composer. If there is an error it is "".
    Then I gather signatures with the composer.
    And I execute the current transaction group with the composer.
    Then The composer should have a status of "COMMITTED".
    And The app should have returned ABI types "(uint64,byte[17]):(uint64,byte[17])".
    And The 0th atomic result for randomInt(42) proves correct
    And The 1th atomic result for randomInt(1337) proves correct
