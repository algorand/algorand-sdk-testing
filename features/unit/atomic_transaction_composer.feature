Feature: Atomic Transaction Composer
  Background:
    Given an algod v2 client
    And a signing account with address "BH55E5RMBD4GYWXGX5W5PJ5JAHPGM5OXKDQH5DC4O2MGI7NW4H6VOE4CP4" and mnemonic "awful drop leaf tennis indoor begin mandate discover uncle seven only coil atom any hospital uncover make any climb actor armed measure need above hundred"

  Scenario Outline: AtomicTransactionComposer test
    Given a new AtomicTransactionComposer
    And suggested transaction parameters fee 1234, flat-fee "true", first-valid 9000, last-valid 9010, genesis-hash "Mf0h6zjkEIEZPtNM3zsrg+iHQFS0fZxhgr7w35I464M=", genesis-id "cucumbernet"
    # Save an application id so we can test method calls
    And an application id <app-id>
    # Prepare a TransactionSigner
    When I make a transaction signer for the signing account.
    # Create a method call with an address argument, and add it to the composer
    And I create the Method object from method signature "<method-signature>"
    # Prepare method call arguments
    And I create a new method arguments array.
    And I append the encoded arguments "<app-args>" to the method arguments array.
    And I add a method call with the signing account, the current application, suggested params, on complete "noop", current transaction signer, current method arguments.
    # Build the group in the composer
    And I build the transaction group with the composer. If there is an error it is "".
    Then The composer should have a status of "BUILT".
    # Try signing and compare the golden with the signed transaction
    And I gather signatures with the composer.
    Then The composer should have a status of "SIGNED".
    And the base64 encoded signed transactions should equal "<goldens>"

    Examples:
      | app-id | method-signature         | app-args                   | goldens |

  Scenario Outline: AtomicTransactionComposer with transaction arguments test

    And I create a transaction with signer with the current transaction.
    # Create a method call with an address argument, and add it to the composer
    And I create the Method object from method signature "<method-signature>"
    # Prepare method call arguments
    And I create a new method arguments array.
    And I append the current transaction with signer to the method arguments array.
    And I append the encoded arguments "<app-args>" to the method arguments array.
    And I add a method call with the signing account, the current application, suggested params, on complete "noop", current transaction signer, current method arguments.
